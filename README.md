# R&D Bundler 3D Plugins

Bundler plugins for optimizing glTF 3D models (.gltf and .glb files).

_Created by [R&D @ The New York Times](https://rd.nytimes.com/)._

## Overview

Monorepo containing plugins for two popular bundlers (Vite and Rollup) allowing each to process and optimize 3D models used by a web application. While bundlers can process traditional web content ‚Äî like CSS or images ‚Äî out of the box or with existing plugins, bundlers lack any understanding of 3D content. This project orchestrates processing of models using the [glTF-Transform](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/) library, and includes configuration flexible enough to select among existing processing stages or to define and add new methods.

Dependencies:

- [glTF Transform](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/): general-purpose glTF processing library
- [Draco](https://github.com/google/draco/): compression for mesh geometry
- [Meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer): compression for mesh geometry, point geometry, animation, and morph targets

## Quickstart

### 1. Installation

Rollup:

```shell
npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-gltf
```

Vite:

```shell
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-gltf
```

### 2. Minimal Configuration

The plugin is unopinionated about which optimizations should be applied to your glTF models. Here is a minimal configuration that simply applies Draco compression of your assets:

```js
// *.config.js
import gltf from "rollup-plugin-gltf"; // (a) Rollup
import gltf from "vite-plugin-gltf"; // (b) Vite

import { draco } from "@gltf-transform/functions";

return {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    gltf({
      transforms: [draco()],
    }),
  ],
};
```

See [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) for more complex examples.

_SvelteKit:_ it seems that in SvelteKit SSR should be disabled in order to avoid mysterious `ReferenceError` issues - see issues filed [here](https://github.com/nytimes/rd-bundler-3d-plugins/issues/19) and on the [SvelteKit repo](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9000).
