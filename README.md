# R&D Bundler 3D Plugins

Bundler plugins for optimizing glTF 3D models (.gltf and .glb files).

_Created by [R&D @ The New York Times](https://rd.nytimes.com/)._

## Overview

Monorepo containing plugins for two popular bundlers (Vite and Rollup) allowing each to process and optimize 3D models used by a web application. While bundlers can process traditional web content — like CSS or images — out of the box or with existing plugins, bundlers lack any understanding of 3D content. This project orchestrates processing of models using the [glTF-Transform](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/) library, and includes configuration flexible enough to select among existing processing stages or to define and add new methods.

Dependencies:

- [glTF Transform](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/): general-purpose glTF processing library
- [Draco](https://github.com/google/draco/): compression for mesh geometry
- [Meshoptimizer](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer): compression for mesh geometry, point geometry, animation, and morph targets

## Quickstart

### 1. Installation

Rollup:

```shell
npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-gltf
```

Vite:

```shell
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-gltf
```

### 2. Minimal Configuration

The plugin is unopinionated about which optimizations should be applied to your glTF models. Here is a minimal configuration that simply applies Draco compression of your assets:

```js
// *.config.js
import gltf from "rollup-plugin-gltf"; // (a) Rollup
import gltf from "vite-plugin-gltf"; // (b) Vite

import { draco } from "@gltf-transform/functions";

return {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    gltf({
      transforms: [draco()],
    }),
  ],
};
```

See [advanced configuration](#advanced-configuration) for more complex examples.

_SvelteKit:_ it seems that in SvelteKit SSR should be disabled in order to avoid mysterious `ReferenceError` issues - see issues filed [here](https://github.com/nytimes/rd-bundler-3d-plugins/issues/19) and on the [SvelteKit repo](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9000).
